# Image Colorization using CNN Autoencoder, Deep CNN, U-Net, Res-Net, Dense-Net and Pix2Pix

In this work we compare multiple architectures and techniques for the **colorization problem** in computer vision, which consists of transforming images from their greyscale version back to their colorized version.  
This task is notorious tough due to the fact that the model has to learn the association color-shape, and theoretically, given a greyscale image, there are multiple possible colorization, and we will show how ***GAN based model*** outperforms *regression based* thanks to the fact that they are not impacted by this latter problem.
